ASIHTTPRequest is an easy to use wrapper around the CFNetwork API that makes some of the more tedious aspects of communicating with web servers easier. It is written in Objective-C and works in both Mac OS X and iPhone applications.

It is suitable performing basic HTTP requests and interacting with REST-based services (GET / POST / PUT / DELETE). The included ASIFormDataRequest subclass makes it easy to submit POST data and files using multipart/form-data.

It provides:
* A straightforward interface for submitting data to and fetching data from webservers
* Download data to memory or directly to a file on disk
* Submit files on local drives as part of POST data, compatible with the HTML file input mechanism
* Stream request bodies directly from disk to the server, to conserve memory
* Resume for partial downloads
* Easy access to request and response HTTP headers
* Progress delegates (NSProgressIndicators and UIProgressViews) to show information about download AND upload progress
* Auto-magic management of upload and download progress indicators for operation queues
* Basic, Digest + NTLM authentication support, credentials are automatically re-used for the duration of a session, and can be stored for later in the Keychain.
* Cookie support
* GZIP support for response data AND request bodies
* Persistent connections support
* Support for Amazon S3
* [NEW] Full support for Rackspace Cloud Files
* Supports manual and autodetected proxies, authenticating proxies, and PAC file autoconfiguration
* Based on NSOperation to make queuing requests and background operation easy
* Comes with a broad range of unit tests
