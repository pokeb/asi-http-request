ASIHTTPRequest is an easy to use wrapper around the CFNetwork API that makes some of the more tedious aspects of communicating with web servers easier. It is written in Objective-C and works in both Mac OS X and iPhone applications.

It is suitable performing basic HTTP requests and interacting with REST-based services (GET / POST / PUT / DELETE). The included ASIFormDataRequest subclass makes it easy to submit POST data and files using multipart/form-data.

####It provides:

* A straightforward interface for submitting data to and fetching data from webservers


* Download data to memory or directly to a file on disk


* Submit files on local drives as part of POST data, compatible with the HTML file input mechanism



* Stream request bodies directly from disk to the server, to conserve memory



* Resume for partial downloads


* Easy access to request and response HTTP headers



* Progress delegates (NSProgressIndicators and UIProgressViews) to show information about download AND upload progress



* Auto-magic management of upload and download progress indicators for operation queues



* Basic, Digest + NTLM authentication support, credentials are automatically re-used for the duration of a session, and can be stored for later in the Keychain.



* Cookie support



* [NEW] Requests can continue to run when your app moves to the background (iOS 4+)



* GZIP support for response data AND request bodies



* The included ASIDownloadCache class lets requests transparently cache responses, and allow requests for cached data to succeed even when there is no network available



* [NEW] ASIWebPageRequest - download complete webpages, including external resources like images and stylesheets. Pages of any size can be indefinitely cached, and displayed in a UIWebview / WebView even when you have no network connection.



* Easy to use support for Amazon S3 - no need to fiddle around signing requests yourself!



* Full support for Rackspace Cloud Files



* [NEW] Client certificates support



* Supports manual and auto-detected proxies, authenticating proxies, and PAC file auto-configuration. The built-in login dialog lets your iPhone application work transparently with authenticating proxies without any additional effort.



* Bandwidth throttling support



* Support for persistent connections



* Supports synchronous & asynchronous requests



* Get notifications about changes in your request state via delegation or [NEW] blocks (Mac OS X 10.6, iOS 4 and above)



* Comes with a broad range of unit tests






ASIHTTPRequest is compatible with Mac OS 32/64bit on 10.6 or later, and iOS 5.1.1 or later.
